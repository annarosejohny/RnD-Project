Various anticipation methods finds application in fields such as autonomous robots, self-driving systems, human-robot interaction. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey on various anticipation methods used for anomaly detection tasks. The existing surveys are application oriented and does not provide a complete evaluation of the methods, metrics, datasets used for anticipation in field of autonomous robot. The survey aims to provide comparison of approaches in field of autonomous systems, thereby increasing their autonomy in operation. 
The anticipation methods are classified into action anticipation, video prediction and trajectory prediction. The datasets and the metrics used for these anticipation approaches are also evaluated in this survey. 
For analysis of different approaches, a comparison table is provided that compares various approaches with contribution and deficit of each approach. This survey helps the manufactures of autonomous systems to identify the best approach in the anticipation field and their applicability for anomaly detection tasks.
